# PostgreSQL Mastery

Repository to collect daily learning notes, example queries, and small projects while mastering PostgreSQL.

Structure

- README.md — this file
- daily-logs/ — daily journal entries
  - week-01/
    - day-00.md
- queries/ — SQL snippets and exercises
  - week-01/
    - day-00.sql
- projects/ — small projects and experiments (each project gets its own folder)

How to use

- Use `daily-logs` for short daily notes: problems, learnings, commands, results.
- Keep runnable SQL in `queries` and reference them from your notes.
- Put any small project in `projects/<project-name>/` with a README and any scripts.

Tips

- Commit frequently and keep queries small and focused.
- Use descriptive filenames that include the week/day or topic.
